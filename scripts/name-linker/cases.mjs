// Named cases for the name linker. This is the fast half of the regression net: it runs in a couple
// of seconds and it says, in words, what each link is supposed to be and why.
//
// Every case names one occurrence of one name in one verse, on one rendering path:
//   path: "reader" (default) — what VerseText.tsx renders; book, chapter and verse are passed.
//   path: "panel"            — what LinkedVerseText.tsx renders; NO context is passed, so none of
//                              the book/verse corrections fire. Used by PersonPanel, LocationPanel,
//                              PoiPanel, TopicPanel and BookIntroView.
//
// `status` is the part that makes this net honest:
//   "guard"       — this resolution is CORRECT. If it changes, something has regressed.
//   "known-wrong" — this is what the linker does today, and it is WRONG. Recorded so the fault
//                   cannot be quietly forgotten, and so the batch that fixes it shows up as this
//                   line changing. Flip to "guard" in the same commit that fixes it.
//   "flagged"     — this resolution is a live confessional or scholarly question that only Robbie
//                   can settle (see §7 of automation/manager/name-linker-scope.md). It is recorded
//                   so that an unrelated change CANNOT alter it without failing this file. Do not
//                   "fix" a flagged case. If your change moves one, back the change out.
//
// Every case below was read against the WEB text of its verse, not recalled.
